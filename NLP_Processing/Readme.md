- Run file main.py to start train model and test, apply model to predict cluster 
- processing_text.py: file preprocessing data text in training test and text from user
- classify_model.py: build and test model SVM and Logistic (traditional machine learning model)
- test.py: i try to using simple deep learning model, model in own_create_mode.py, but the result is not good because my training data is too small to use DL
 
 - Dataset is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opXQCImLuZyxDXpMAExyZnZlZRMC58Xc/view?usp=sharing, download and unzip it in project.
